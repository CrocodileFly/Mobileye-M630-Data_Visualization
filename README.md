# Mobileye-M630-Data_Vsualization
## A software for Mobileye-M630 data visualization. 
The Mobileye product M630 only gives CAN data output(velocity or location of Vehicles, Pedstrians and bicycles) without vedio flow. This software is developed for the visualization of the scenario around the ego vehicle which shows the real-time movements and locations of obstacles and ego road lanes.
